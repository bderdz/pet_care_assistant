        "As a pet owner, I know how hard is it to rise and care for an animal. There were situations that i wish someone/something would explain me how to do it. So i came up with an idea to make an AI Pet Care Assistant. Which can generate diet, activity, health care plan and answer for your questions about your pet. All based on your pet profile that you give to the Assistant and additional documents about pets (RAG) or also by using Google Search grounding.\n",

        "Adult domestic cats require on average 50 to 70 kilocalories per kilogram of body weight per day. A healthy intact adult cat weighing 4.5 kg will typically need 225 to 315 kcal per day, depending on activity level and environment. Neutered cats require less energy due to lower metabolic rate. For a neutered cat of the same weight, the daily caloric requirement is approximately 180 to 220 kcal.\n",
        "Neutered cats are at higher risk of obesity and urinary tract problems. Their diet should include high protein (at least 35% of dry matter), moderate fat (10–15%), and reduced energy density. Commercial diets for neutered cats often provide 300–350 kcal per 100g for dry food and around 80–100 kcal per 100g for wet food. Feeding guidelines should follow manufacturer recommendations, adjusted for individual condition and activity.\n",
        "Non-neutered cats with access to the outdoors may require higher energy intake, up to 300 kcal/day for a 4.5 kg cat. Their diet should remain rich in animal protein (above 30% dry matter), with fat content around 15–20%, and limited carbohydrates (<10%). These cats benefit from a mix of wet and dry food, or high-quality raw diets formulated to meet FEDIAF or AAFCO standards.\n",
        "Feeding frequency for adult cats should be 2 to 3 times per day. Free feeding is discouraged for neutered indoor cats due to the risk of overeating. Kittens up to 6 months should be fed 3–4 times daily with energy-dense food (up to 100 kcal per kg body weight). Senior cats (above 10 years) often require adjusted diets with reduced phosphorus and added omega-3 for kidney and joint health.\n",
        "Water intake is critical. Daily water requirement is about 40–60 ml per kilogram of body weight. For a 4.5 kg cat, this equals 180–270 ml daily. Wet food typically contains 70–80% moisture, providing hydration as part of the diet. For cats eating dry food (7–10% moisture), additional water must be provided. Cats often prefer running water; a fountain can increase fluid intake.\n",
        "Essential nutrients include taurine (minimum 25 mg/100 kcal), arachidonic acid, vitamin A (not beta-carotene), and niacin. Deficiencies in these nutrients lead to severe health issues. Commercial diets should comply with FEDIAF or AAFCO nutritional profiles. Home-prepared or raw diets must be balanced with professional guidance to avoid deficiencies or excesses.\n",
        "Obesity prevention includes body condition scoring, meal control, and activity enrichment. Puzzle feeders and scheduled play (at least 15–20 minutes daily) help stimulate activity. For overweight neutered cats, caloric restriction to 70–80% of maintenance energy needs may be necessary, under veterinary supervision. Gradual weight loss (1–2% per week) is recommended.\n",
        "Treats should not exceed 10% of daily caloric intake. Avoid toxic human foods such as onions, garlic, chocolate, grapes, raisins, alcohol, caffeine, and bones. Milk and dairy often cause gastrointestinal upset due to lactose intolerance. Raw fish or liver should only be given in moderation and properly handled.\n",

        "DOCUMENT2 = \"\"\"\n",
        "Adult dogs require between 95 to 130 kilocalories per kilogram of metabolic body weight (kg^0.75) per day. The specific caloric needs vary depending on size, breed, activity level, and neuter status. For example, a 20 kg neutered adult dog with moderate activity may need around 800 to 950 kcal/day, while an intact working dog of the same weight may require 1,100 to 1,400 kcal/day.\n",
        "Neutered dogs typically have reduced energy needs (by 20–25%) due to hormonal changes affecting metabolism and appetite regulation. To prevent obesity, caloric intake should be adjusted accordingly. Diets for neutered dogs should be lower in fat (8–12% dry matter), high in digestible protein (above 22–25% dry matter), and include fiber (2.5–5%) to promote satiety.\n",
        "Feeding frequency should be 2 meals per day for most adult dogs. Smaller breeds with high metabolic rates may benefit from 3 meals. Large and deep-chested breeds are prone to gastric torsion (bloat), so feeding should be divided into multiple smaller meals with rest before and after.\n",
        "Water is essential, with dogs needing about 50–60 ml per kilogram of body weight per day. A 20 kg dog should consume 1–1.2 liters daily. Wet food (75–80% moisture) contributes to hydration; dry food (8–10%) requires access to clean water at all times. Increased water intake is necessary in hot climates or for active dogs.\n",
        "Dry food (kibble) typically provides 350–450 kcal per 100g, while wet food delivers 70–100 kcal per 100g. Portioning should consider not just weight but also activity and condition. Overfeeding dry kibble is a common cause of weight gain in indoor or low-exercise dogs.\n",
        "Macronutrient recommendations for adult maintenance diets:\n",
        "- Protein: 18–25% (dry matter); higher for active or athletic dogs\n",
        "- Fat: 8–15% (dry matter); active dogs may require up to 20%\n",
        "- Carbohydrates: 30–50% (dry matter), including digestible starches and fiber\n",
        "- Fiber: 2–5%; moderate levels support digestive health\n",
        "Essential micronutrients include calcium (1–2%), phosphorus (0.8–1.6%), vitamin E (minimum 50 IU/kg), vitamin D (minimum 500 IU/kg), B-vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., DHA and EPA from fish oil). Commercial foods formulated to AAFCO or FEDIAF standards provide these in adequate proportions.\n",
        "Obesity is one of the most common nutritional disorders in dogs. Weight gain should be prevented through portion control, use of low-calorie treats (not exceeding 10% of daily calories), and daily exercise (at least 30 minutes of walking or play). Weight loss protocols typically reduce energy intake to 70% of maintenance needs, with regular monitoring of body condition score (BCS).\n",
        "Dogs with medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, kidney disease, food allergies) require specialized diets. Veterinary therapeutic diets are formulated for these cases and should be used under supervision. Transitioning to a new diet should be gradual, over 5–7 days, to avoid gastrointestinal upset.\n",
        "Homemade or raw diets must be nutritionally complete and balanced. Common deficiencies in DIY diets include calcium, vitamin D, and zinc. All homemade feeding should be based on veterinary-approved recipes and ideally monitored with periodic bloodwork.\n",
        "Dangerous foods for dogs include chocolate, onions, garlic, grapes, raisins, alcohol, caffeine, xylitol, and cooked bones. High-fat table scraps can cause pancreatitis. Dairy is poorly tolerated in some adult dogs. Treats such as jerky or biscuits should be carefully portioned to avoid excess calorie intake.\n",
        "Monitoring stool quality, coat condition, and weight provides early indicators of dietary sufficiency. Adjustments should be based on regular assessment and guided by a veterinarian or certified nutritionist.\n",

        "DOCUMENT3 = \"\"\"\n",
        "Dogs require daily physical exercise to maintain their health. Regular physical activity is essential to prevent obesity, promote good cardiovascular health, and reduce anxiety. The level of activity depends on the breed, age, and health of the dog.\n",
        "For highly active breeds, such as Border Collies, Huskies, and Labrador Retrievers, vigorous exercise is necessary. These breeds thrive on activities like Long runs, Fetch, Agility training, Herding or pulling activities (for working breeds).\n",
        "Less active breeds, such as Bulldogs, Pugs, and Dachshunds, require less intense exercise. Daily walks are still important, but these dogs do not require as much vigorous activity. Shorter walks or playtime in a small yard may be sufficient.\n",
        "Puppies generally have a lot of energy and need more frequent play and shorter walks, while senior dogs may need more rest. It is important to adjust the level of activity according to the dog’s age and health.\n",
        "Mental stimulation is also important. Dogs enjoy problem-solving, sniffing, training, and exploring new places. Without exercise, dogs may become destructive, anxious, or overweight.\n",
        "Dogs benefit from a mix of mental and physical stimulation. Puzzle toys, obedience training, and interactive games are good for keeping a dog’s mind engaged.\n",

            "User: Luna is a lively three-year-old female Border Collie. She weighs 15.2 kg and has a high activity level – she loves long walks and playing with frisbees. She has been spayed and is generally healthy, although she has a mild allergy to chicken.\n",

            "User: make diet plan\n",
            "Model: To create a suitable diet plan for Luna, here are some guidelines to consider:\n",
            "\n",
            "Adult dogs need 95 to 130 kilocalories per kilogram of metabolic body weight each day, but this can change based on her size, breed, activity level, and whether she is spayed.\n",
            "A Border Collie that is moderately active and spayed might need about 800 to 950 kcal per day.\n",
            "If Luna is a working dog and not spayed, she might need between 1,100 to 1,400 kcal per day.\n",
            "Spayed dogs usually need 20–25% fewer calories because of hormone changes that affect their metabolism and appetite.\n",
            "\n",
            "To keep Luna from gaining too much weight, adjust how much she eats.\n",
            "Choose foods that are lower in fat (8–12% dry matter), high in protein (above 22–25% dry matter), and include fiber (2.5–5%) to help her feel full.\n",
            "Most adult dogs should eat two meals a day.\n",
            "However, large and deep-chested breeds should have their food divided into multiple smaller meals to avoid bloat, with rest before and after eating.\n",
            "\n",
            "Make sure Luna drinks about 50–60 ml of water per kilogram of her body weight each day, so a 20 kg dog should drink 1–1.2 liters daily.\n",
            "If Luna eats wet food (75–80% moisture), that will help with hydration, but if she eats dry food (8–10% moisture), always have clean water available.\n",
            "She will need more water in hot weather or if she is very active.\n",
            "Dry food usually has 350–450 kcal per 100g, while wet food has 70–100 kcal per 100g.\n",
            "\n",
            "When deciding how much to feed her, think about her activity level and body condition.\n",
            "Giving too much dry kibble is a common reason for weight gain.\n",
            "\n",
            "Luna's diet should include:\n",
            "\n",
            "18–25% protein (dry matter), with more for active dogs.\n",
            "8–15% fat (dry matter), up to 20% for active dogs.\n",
            "30–50% carbohydrates (dry matter), including starches and fiber.\n",
            "2–5% fiber to help with digestion.\n",
            "\n",
            "She also needs essential micronutrients like calcium (1–2%), phosphorus (0.8–1.6%), vitamin E (minimum 50 IU/kg), vitamin D (minimum 500 IU/kg), B-vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil.\n",
            "Commercial dog foods that meet AAFCO or FEDIAF standards should have these in the right amounts.\n",
            "\n",
            "To prevent Luna from becoming overweight, control her portions, give her low-calorie treats (less than 10% of her daily calories), and make sure she gets at least 30 minutes of exercise each day.\n",
            "If she needs to lose weight, reduce her food intake to 70% of what she needs to maintain her current weight and check her body condition regularly.\n",
            "\n",
            "If Luna has any health issues, like diabetes, kidney disease, or food allergies, she might need a special diet prescribed by a vet.\n",
            "When changing her food, do it slowly over 5–7 days to avoid upsetting her stomach.\n",
            "\n",
            "Never feed Luna chocolate, onions, garlic, grapes, raisins, alcohol, caffeine, xylitol, or cooked bones, as these are dangerous for dogs.\n",
            "Also, be careful with high-fat table scraps, as they can cause pancreatitis, and limit dairy, as some adult dogs don't tolerate it well.\n",
            "\n",
            "Keep an eye on Luna's stool quality, coat condition, and weight to make sure she is getting the right nutrition.\n",
            "Adjust her diet as needed, based on regular check-ups and advice from your vet or a certified nutritionist.\n",
            "User: now i need activity \n",
            "Model: For Luna the Border Collie, who is a highly active breed, you will want to focus on vigorous exercise.\n",
            "\n",
            "Long runs will help keep her in shape.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fetch is a great way to let her run and burn off energy.\n",
            "\n",

            "To create a suitable diet plan for Luna, here are some guidelines to consider:\n",
            "\n",
            "Adult dogs need 95 to 130 kilocalories per kilogram of metabolic body weight each day, but this can change based on her size, breed, activity level, and whether she is spayed.\n",
            "A Border Collie that is moderately active and spayed might need about 800 to 950 kcal per day.\n",
            "If Luna is a working dog and not spayed, she might need between 1,100 to 1,400 kcal per day.\n",
            "Spayed dogs usually need 20–25% fewer calories because of hormone changes that affect their metabolism and appetite.\n",
            "\n",
            "To keep Luna from gaining too much weight, adjust how much she eats.\n",
            "Choose foods that are lower in fat (8–12% dry matter), high in protein (above 22–25% dry matter), and include fiber (2.5–5%) to help her feel full.\n",
            "Most adult dogs should eat two meals a day.\n",
            "However, large and deep-chested breeds should have their food divided into multiple smaller meals to avoid bloat, with rest before and after eating.\n",
            "\n",
            "Make sure Luna drinks about 50–60 ml of water per kilogram of her body weight each day, so a 20 kg dog should drink 1–1.2 liters daily.\n",
            "If Luna eats wet food (75–80% moisture), that will help with hydration, but if she eats dry food (8–10% moisture), always have clean water available.\n",
            "She will need more water in hot weather or if she is very active.\n",
            "Dry food usually has 350–450 kcal per 100g, while wet food has 70–100 kcal per 100g.\n",
            "\n",
            "When deciding how much to feed her, think about her activity level and body condition.\n",
            "Giving too much dry kibble is a common reason for weight gain.\n",
            "\n",
            "Luna's diet should include:\n",
            "\n",
            "18–25% protein (dry matter), with more for active dogs.\n",
            "8–15% fat (dry matter), up to 20% for active dogs.\n",
            "30–50% carbohydrates (dry matter), including starches and fiber.\n",
            "2–5% fiber to help with digestion.\n",
            "\n",
            "She also needs essential micronutrients like calcium (1–2%), phosphorus (0.8–1.6%), vitamin E (minimum 50 IU/kg), vitamin D (minimum 500 IU/kg), B-vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil.\n",
            "Commercial dog foods that meet AAFCO or FEDIAF standards should have these in the right amounts.\n",
            "\n",
            "To prevent Luna from becoming overweight, control her portions, give her low-calorie treats (less than 10% of her daily calories), and make sure she gets at least 30 minutes of exercise each day.\n",
            "If she needs to lose weight, reduce her food intake to 70% of what she needs to maintain her current weight and check her body condition regularly.\n",
            "\n",
            "If Luna has any health issues, like diabetes, kidney disease, or food allergies, she might need a special diet prescribed by a vet.\n",
            "When changing her food, do it slowly over 5–7 days to avoid upsetting her stomach.\n",
            "\n",
            "Never feed Luna chocolate, onions, garlic, grapes, raisins, alcohol, caffeine, xylitol, or cooked bones, as these are dangerous for dogs.\n",
            "Also, be careful with high-fat table scraps, as they can cause pancreatitis, and limit dairy, as some adult dogs don't tolerate it well.\n",
            "\n",
            "Keep an eye on Luna's stool quality, coat condition, and weight to make sure she is getting the right nutrition.\n",
            "Adjust her diet as needed, based on regular check-ups and advice from your vet or a certified nutritionist.\n",
            "\n",
            "Activity:\n",
            "For Luna the Border Collie, who is a highly active breed, you will want to focus on vigorous exercise.\n",

            "Long runs will help keep her in shape.\n",
