# AI Pet Care Assistant
### 🔎 Introduction
As a pet owner, I know how hard is it to rise and care for an animal. There were situations that i wish someone/something would explain me how to do it. So i came up with an idea to make an AI Pet Care Assistant. Which can generate diet, activity, health care plan and answer for your questions about your pet. All based on your pet profile that you give to the Assistant and additional documents about pets (RAG) or also by using Google Search grounding.
